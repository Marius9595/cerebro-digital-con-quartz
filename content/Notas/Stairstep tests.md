## ¿Qué es?
>Some tests are written just to force us to create classes or functions or other  structures that we’re going to need. Sometimes these tests are so degenerate that they assert  nothing. Other times they assert something very naive. Often these tests are superseded by  more comprehensive tests later and can be safely deleted. We call these kinds of tests stairstep  tests because they are like stairs that allow us to incrementally increase the complexity to the  appropriate level.
